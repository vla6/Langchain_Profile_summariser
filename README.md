# Langchain Profile Summariser

**This is a fork from [omkmorendha](https://github.com/omkmorendha/Langchain_Profile_summariser/tree/main)**

A Langchain application that uses OpenAI, SerpAPI, Nubela API to find information and make inferences about someone using only their name.

APIs used:
1. OpenAI 
2. Nubela
3. SerpAI

We first input a name to a web-application that I created using Flask, which is then passed to the SerpAPI that scrapes the Internet to find a LinkedIn profile page associated with that name,
the profile page is than sent to Nubela API that converts this into a JSON, which is then passed to OpenAI API that gives us some inferences about the person such as a short summary, some interesting facts,
what could be a potential ice-breaker with that person and finally their interests.

All of the above steps are carried out by a Langchain agent.
